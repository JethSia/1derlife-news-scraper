First, as science tells us that we have a decade to reduce emissions dramatically or face the worst impacts of climate change, many of those impacts have already arrived at our door. From the historic and deadly wildfires in Australia and California, to severe flooding around the world, there is no denying that climate change is already disrupting our daily lives. At the same time, support for climate action has never been stronger—from Generation Z’s solutions-oriented mindset, to political support that increasingly crosses party lines, to Europe’s large-scale ambition to become the first ­carbon-neutral continent, society is ever more unified against the threat of climate change.

Second, we are seeing promising technologies and policies that will bring carbon-free energy within reach. Not long ago, it was hard to imagine a 24/7 carbon-free electricity supply. At its most basic level, the wind does not always blow and the sun does not shine at night. But new technologies—including better energy storage and the reduction of costs associated with wind and solar power by 70% and 89% respectively over the past ten years—are bringing 24/7 carbon-free energy closer to reality.

Another of those technologies is artificial intelligence (AI). At Google, we are working on ways to apply AI to optimise electricity consumption within our data centres. In collaboration with our sister venture, DeepMind, we have developed solutions that have reduced the amount of energy used to cool our data centres by 30%. This approach could be used by commercial buildings, including airports and shopping malls, to do the same. AI can also be used to make wind power more predictable, which will increase the value, utilisation and adoption of renewable energy.

Meanwhile, sensors on satellites can locate large-scale emitters of carbon dioxide at a very fine-grained level. This could dramatically improve the effectiveness of the Paris climate agreement. Technology is also helping cities reduce their carbon emissions. According to the Global Covenant of Mayors, an international alliance of over 10,000 cities and local governments committed to fighting climate change, less than 20% of cities outside western Europe have the time, resources and data to meet their climate commitments. With platforms like our own Environmental Insights Explorer, cities can use anonymised, aggregated mapping data to estimate the carbon footprint of their buildings and transport, and realise their solar-energy potential—a critical step, as cities continue to contribute over 70% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions.

Technology is also helping communities adapt to the effects of climate change that are already apparent. As one example, we are able to use satellite data to map wildfires in real time and better predict how they might spread. In India, flood forecasting models use AI to predict when floods will hit and how deep the waters will get, helping save lives. Machine learning is also being applied to “nowcast” rainfall sooner and with more accuracy than con­ventional forecasting methods, helping people make safer, more informed decisions.

Driven by these promising trends and tools, companies have made bigger sustainability commitments in shorter time frames. At Google, we have eliminated our carbon legacy using high-quality offsets, and set a goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy in all our data centres and campuses worldwide by 2030. Our aim is to demonstrate that a 100% carbon-free electrical grid is not just possible but also economically viable. We hope that companies of all sizes will join us in this effort.

In addition to concrete and ambitious company commitments, the world also needs enabling policies and global frameworks to ensure we are working towards the same goals. We know it’s possible: we have seen this kind of collaboration during the pandemic, as the private sector worked with governments to deliver personal protective equipment, medical devices and contact-tracing apps needed to fight the virus. Stronger public-private partnerships will be just as critical in fighting climate change.

Throughout history, every generation has confronted big challenges. Climate change will be our generation’s most profound challenge—and in 2021, the world will take its biggest steps yet to meet it.■

THE Roding Roadster, a sports car unveiled at last September's Frankfurt motor show, has a powerful motor and lightweight construction that promise a thrilling ride. But at Munich's Technical University (TUM), which the Roding's designers attended, there is even more buzz about the Tesla, a battery-powered car from California. It shows that electro-mobility “could be fast and fun”, says Markus Lienkamp, who teaches car technology at TUM. Annoyingly, Tesla opened a dealership in Munich on BMW's doorstep.

Germany invented the modern internal-combustion engine and intends to be a leader in any future automotive technology. It has helped to spread the idea that modern life can be transposed into planet-friendly technology. The government's promise to put 1m electric cars on the road by 2020 is one of many initiatives to ensure that Germany cashes in. So Tesla's brash entrance into the green enclosure was met with a mixture of derision and fear. Surely slapdash American engineering will be put to shame by the inventive perfectionism of the German Tüftler, car folk mutter. But that is a hope, not a certainty. Mr Lienkamp welcomes the threat. “When a German engineer gets angry,” he advises, “watch out.”

Germany is confused about its technological identity. On the one hand it embraces the new. It ranks fourth among countries in the number of patents filed per person and comes close to the top in international surveys of innovation. On the other hand it has few enterprises emerging from garages to wreck everyone else's business model. The closest German equivalent to Google is SAP, a software firm that is pushing 40. Germans who want to convert bright ideas into riches go to America, says McKinsey's Mr Mattern. Only 4% of the working-age population is engaged in early-stage entrepreneurial activity, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, against America's 8%.

How much does that matter? Germany has done pretty well with cars, machines and chemicals, medium-tech products as measured by the share of turnover invested in research and development (R&D). Just because innovation is hidden does not mean it is not there. “A BMW has more software than the space shuttle,” says Manfred Broy, a professor of information technology at TUM. Germany is in pole position in several fast-growing “green tech” areas, including renewable energy and automotive efficiency. But the arrival of the Tesla shows that Germany could still lose the race.

Sharpen up

Decision-makers are haunted by the thought that the country's only marketable raw material is brainpower and that the number of brains is shrinking. Germany underspends on education and R&D (see chart 4), and just a fifth of scientists and engineers are aged 25-34, the lowest share in the EU. As catalysts of new ideas, German universities lag behind American and British ones. Venture capital had a late and inauspicious start, just before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, which stunted its subsequent growth.

Mrs Merkel, herself a physicist, has attended to these deficits with methodical doggedness. Her 2005-09 grand coalition stepped up support for government-funded research institutes and launched an “excellence initiative” to promote elite universities and programmes. Her new coalition plans to spend an extra €12 billion on education and to offer a big tax break for R&D. “We've sent a signal on education and research that no one else has sent,” says the education minister, Annette Schavan.

Much of this money will flow into realising Germany's biggest idea: that German engineering and environmentalism will join forces to provide industry with a second wind. “Whoever is first to conquer green-tech markets will have an enduring export advantage and create jobs,” Mrs Merkel has declared.

Green tech is a broad and slippery concept. Just about anything can be done more cleanly, and it would be surprising if Germans were not the first to do it in industries they lead. The German government has been sending steady green signals to the market for years. It passed a trend-setting recycling law in 1991 and was a pioneer of “feed-in tariffs”, obliging utilities to buy power generated by renewable sources at prices that reflect their higher costs. Now renewables account for 15% of electricity and German manufacturers of solar cells and wind-power turbines are among the world's leaders.

The place to be

In energy-saving fixes for cars with traditional engines, such as lightweight materials and stop-start brakes, “Germany is worldwide absolutely in front”, says Christian Malorny of McKinsey. Even the Mittelstand has joined the general green mobilisation, in part because its German customers demand it. Licon, which makes machinery for the car industry, puts energy-storing brakes on its own machinery.

Using a broad definition, Roland Berger, a consultancy, reckons that the global green-tech market was worth €1.4 trillion in 2007 and is likely to grow to €3.1 trillion by 2020, outstripping vehicle production. Germany is well positioned, with market shares of 30% in power generation and 20% in “sustainable mobility”. Green tech could create 1m new jobs by 2020. “This is a good and growing story,” says Roland Berger's Torsten Henzelmann.

But Mrs Merkel's hopes of conquering green markets are optimistic. Competition there is as hot as anywhere else, as the solar industry is already finding out. The Chinese have jumped in with lower prices. Last year demand slumped along with prices of silicon, the main raw material for solar cells, dealing a double blow to firms locked into higher-priced silicon contracts. Now the government wants to accelerate the cuts in the feed-in tariff for solar power, which is four times the going rate for electricity. Q-Cells, the biggest firm in “Solar Valley” in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt, has already shifted some production to Malaysia. High-value-added photovoltaic products will be made in Germany, says Q-Cells' Marko Schulz, but simple products will move abroad.

It might seem odd that makers of fast cars for people unfazed by the cost of fuel should worry about retooling them for a greener age, but the Germans reckon greenery plays to their strengths. Besides, they have little choice. Under EU law carmakers have until 2020 to reduce CO2 emissions significantly. BMW is determined that this should cause no loss of Fahrfreude (driving joy). They use the catchphrase “EfficientDynamics” to describe their efforts to reconcile the two. These are mostly “easy things” like fiddling with aerodynamics or pumping coolant “on demand”, says Hans Rathgeber, BMW's head of vehicle architecture. Improvements to conventional cars will go most of the way towards meeting the EU emissions targets, says McKinsey's Mr Malorny. The final stretch will require adoption of radically new technologies, such as battery power.

Will German carmakers master a technology that came of age as a power source for video games? The answer matters not only to the industry but also to the country's future as an innovator. BMW says that electric vehicles will not replace conventional cars or hybrids for the foreseeable future: their range is too short and they take too long to charge. But the company will be ready. It is developing new “mobility concepts” for large cities. Last year it signed an agreement with Bosch, a German parts-maker, and Samsung, a Korean electronics firm, to buy batteries for an urban electric car. What makes a BMW is not the fuel source or even the engine. According to Ulrich Kranz, the company's resident futurologist, cars are “a huge interactive system” that BMW manages.

But even futurologists can be surprised. Profitable ideas can come from anywhere. That is why Mr Lienkamp at TUM leads a team that is developing its own ideas for a commercially viable electric car. An innovative society is one that hedges its bets by having as many thoughts—and thinkers—as possible.",https://www.economist.com/special-report/2010/03/13/the-green-machine

The battle lines are being drawn in Asia over green technologies, as governments adapt their tradition of state influence on industry for an era in which eco-friendly products may spell export success. In China, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere, a big portion of fiscal-stimulus measures is dedicated to green projects. It is seen as a way to create new jobs, cut carbon emissions at home—and sell products abroad.

Globally, governments have budgeted as much as $500 billion for “Green New Deal” projects, estimates HSBC, a bank. Asia accounts for more than three-fifths of the total. Around 20% of this will have been spent by the end of 2009, with most of the rest to be lavished in 2010. Private capital is also pouring in.

Yet where the money is going varies across the region. Some countries are emphasising particular sectors (like solar power) or early-stage technology (such as fuel cells) with an eye towards building a future market. Other initiatives simply apply current technology to reduce domestic emissions (carbon-capture at power plants, for example). Only 15% of the spending is aimed at R&D, notes New Energy Finance, a market-research group.

China, by some measures, has the most ambitious policy. It has dedicated around $220 billion, or one-third of its overall fiscal stimulus, to projects such as wind, solar, hydropower and clean-coal technologies. This will help the country achieve its target of increasing the share of renewable energy to 10% by 2010.

In 2010 a generous subsidy will become available for low-emission cars in 13 big cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Dalian. China will also subsidise 50-70% of the cost of large solar-power projects.

The emphasis on solar energy is as much a lifeline for floundering Chinese firms as it is an effort to reduce emissions. Without subsidies, solar is about four times more expensive than energy from the coal-powered grid. But Chinese firms have emerged as the biggest solar-panel producers in the world—almost all of it exported—just as the industry faces a massive supply glut that is forcing firms to close. By boosting domestic demand, China's programme has the added goal of absorbing the excess supply, and helping the firms to live.

South Korea has made green technology a cornerstone of national policy. The budget, about $60 billion to be spent by 2012, is smaller than China's but represents a whopping four-fifths of South Korea's total stimulus package. In 2010 tax incentives, subsidies, credit guarantees and spending programmes will begin to be showered on everything from hybrid cars to fitting buildings with energy-efficient LED lighting.

The country plans to spend around 2% of its GDP on green tech through to 2013, to reduce emissions and spur a new export industry. Sandwiched between China (with lower costs) and Japan (with superior technology), Korean manufacturers have much catching up to do in green-tech products. Bureaucrats hope to increase South Korea's global market share in these technologies from 2% to 8% by 2013.

Japan has long been a green-tech pioneer. It has set aside $35 billion of its stimulus, about 6%, for green tech, in areas such as subsidies for residential solar projects. Its green stimulus is smaller than its neighbours' as it already pours in funds from the regular budget: $22 billion for the environment and conservation in 2009, of which $7 billion was for clean energy including nuclear power. The new government has set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions. It also promises new spending in 2010 for low-emission cars and energy-efficient appliances.

Other Asian countries have green ambitions. Singapore has a war chest of $450m and in 2010 it will build a 55-hectare (135-acre) clean-tech office park and fund a solar-power research institute. Taiwan plans to spend $1 billion over five years developing solar, LED-lighting and renewable-energy technologies.

Any colour you want so long as it's...

What exactly counts as green technology? The figures include water and waste projects that are green, but not energy-related. Almost $100 billion of China's stimulus is for energy-efficient rail transport—which may reduce emissions, but is ultimately just a train system.

Still, the focus on green tech is a natural evolution for Asia's IT industries. LCD screens and semiconductor chips share the same materials and manufacturing processes as solar photo-voltaic cells; many factories have simply been converted from one to the other. The battery technology for electric cars applies the intellectual property that was developed for electronic gadgets.

Whether the bureaucrats can channel the public largesse efficiently is an open question. Since the immediate purpose is to pump-prime the economy, the emphasis will be on dispensing the money rather than on the return on investment.

WHEN IT COMES to energy, no country generates such bittersweet superlatives as China. It is the world’s largest consumer of coal and the second-largest of oil, after America. It has the largest power-generation capacity, by a wide margin. It also produces more carbon dioxide than any other country.

China is hoping to deal with this over-dependence on fossil fuels partly by rebalancing the economy away from energy-intensive industries. But it also leads the world in clean energy. In recent years, through a combination of subsidies, policy targets and manufacturing incentives, it has spent more on cleaning up its energy system than America and the EU combined. Last year alone it shelled out $132bn, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), a consultancy.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) says China has one-third of the world’s wind power, a quarter of its solar capacity, six of the top ten solar-panel manufacturers and four of the top ten wind-turbine makers. It sells more electric vehicles than the rest of the world combined. It also leads the world in construction of nuclear power plants. In December it gave the go-ahead for what is expected to be the world’s largest carbon-trading scheme.

Given China’s thirst for energy, the combined impact of these advances in renewables is still relatively small. Non-fossil-fuel energy, chiefly hydro and nuclear, accounts for only 12% of its total energy mix. And China is far from self-sufficient. That is why, for the next decade at least, China’s main energy-related geopolitical concern will be the need to secure fossil fuels.

This is already evident in the plethora of deals that its state-owned companies are doing with oil and gas producers in the Middle East and Russia, both to finance new projects and to help develop them. But China is also reaching out to America.

Zou Ji of the Energy Foundation, a think-tank, says the immediate priority for China’s energy policymakers is to curb the dirtiest uses of coal, especially heating urban homes with it. For this, America’s shale revolution may be a blessing, he says. By adding large quantities of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to global markets, it has made it cheaper and easier for China’s coastal areas to switch from coal to gas. Last year the country’s LNG imports grew by 50%.

Increasingly China is looking to America to help it diversify its sources of supply. In February China National Petroleum Corporation, a state behemoth, signed the first ever long-term contract to buy LNG from an American supplier, Texas-based Cheniere Energy. Mr Zou says that more energy interdependence between China and America, particularly in the LNG market, could be good for relations between the two superpowers, especially if it helps reduce America’s trade deficit with China.

Eventually, China’s increasing production and use of renewables, batteries and electric vehicles (EVs) are also likely to have geopolitical consequences, even if that is not the government’s primary aim. China could benefit in three ways.

All power to the yellow emperor

First, by being able to produce more of its own energy, it will reduce its reliance on fuel imports that may be vulnerable to global instability. Second, its “soft power” will be strengthened. This is already evident in its leadership role in the Paris climate agreement. Third, and perhaps most important, the development of clean-energy technologies—especially batteries and EVs—could put it firmly in the vanguard of the energy transition, ahead of America and Europe, and provide a new impetus for economic growth.

Currently the race is wide open. No country has an unassailable lead. Whether clean-energy technology becomes a source of healthy competition or geopolitical friction will depend largely on global trade. If it becomes bogged down in protectionism, trade wars and cyber-crime, everyone will lose. But that need not happen. So far, many in the West have been sceptical about China’s role in renewable-energy technology. The country’s solar industry is thought to have piggybacked on Germany’s generous renewable-energy subsidies and has benefited from massive government support. In 2012 the European Commission launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations of Chinese solar-panel imports. The following year the two sides reached a settlement, followed by the imposition of minimum prices. In 2014 America slapped import duties on Chinese solar-panel imports. In January the Trump administration imposed more tariffs on imported solar panels, most of which come from China. The Chinese have bungled some of their own renewable-energy policies, building large-scale projects in remote locations without the transmission lines to support them. Some Western experts argue that China lacks adequate regulatory structures for a smooth transition to clean energy. And in 2010 the Chinese authorities halted most exports of rare earths, raising fears about their stranglehold on the supply of minerals critical to green-energy technology (see article). However, such criticisms risk underplaying the sheer entrepreneurial zeal that the Chinese put into clean energy, and their growing ambition to decentralise as well as decarbonise the energy supply. Both may give China a dominant position in developing the energy technologies of the future.

For instance, the world’s biggest solar-panel manufacturer, Shanghai-based Jinko Solar, is a relative newcomer that started only 11 years ago. Since 2013 it has quintupled global production to a mighty 10 gigawatts (GW) a year and doubled its global market share to 10%. Gener Miao, its head of sales, explains that the firm has succeeded by internationalising its marketing efforts and relentlessly investing in technology. Support from the Chinese government now mostly goes on early-stage research projects, he claims.

Another case in point is one of China’s biggest wind-turbine developers, Envision, also from Shanghai. It has invented turbines that operate at low wind speeds so they can be placed close to urban centres, rather than in the country’s remote northwest. But the company views the turbines merely as a cash cow for a bigger ambition: to create a global “energy internet”, or operating system, that helps companies manage locally produced, or “distributed”, energy assets such as turbines and solar panels, electric vehicles, battery storage and commercial electrical appliances. Launched in 2016, Envision says the system already manages more than 100GW of renewable assets globally (more than America’s entire wind capacity).

China is also upgrading its regulatory structure. Sophie Lu of BNEF says that distributed solar energy accounted for almost one-third of the 53GW of new solar capacity installed in China last year. This surprised everyone because until recently all renewable energy had been installed in remote areas on a utility scale. The aim is to spur reform of China’s gargantuan power company, State Grid. “The government is using technology, innovation and power-market reform to break the monopoly of the grid,” says Ms Lu.

In future the main bone of contention may be the new technologies developed to make renewable energy and storage ever more cost-competitive. Some American experts fret that by giving a low priority to renewable energy, the Trump administration may put America’s industry at a disadvantage in relation to China’s. Since President Trump decided to pull out of the Paris agreement, he appears to have jettisoned America’s pledge to double the $6.4bn the government is due to spend on energy innovation by 2020. China pledged $7.6bn, so it may soon take the lead. Equally telling, research by Devashree Saha and Mark Muro of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, shows that patents and venture-capital investment in clean-energy technologies in America recently peaked. Patenting, they said, was increasingly done by foreign firms, especially Chinese ones.

If China’s growth in clean-energy technology leads to more protectionism, along the lines of the Trump administration’s move in January against imports of solar panels, clean tech could become a trade battleground. The same could happen if China denies Western energy technology a meaningful place in its markets (as it has done with American internet firms) or restricts access to its rare earths. But technology also provides scope for collaboration. If America, the EU and China can build that into the transition to renewables, energy geopolitics will start to look a lot more promising.",https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/03/15/china-is-rapidly-developing-its-clean-energy-technology
4,2011-03-12,Betting on green,"Mr Khosla has a different plan to save the planet. He is investing over $1 billion of his clients' money in “black swans”—ideas with the potential for sudden jumps in technology that promise huge environmental benefits, easy scalability and rapid payback. The catch? Mr Khosla expects nine out of ten of his investments to fail.","“ENVIRONMENTALISTS are fiddling while Rome burns,” says Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture-capital firm.
But, like the environmentalists he scorns, Mr Khosla puts most of his energy into seeking alternatives to traditional fossil fuels.
“I would love to say that Vinod is starting a trend,” says Steve Westly, another venture capitalist focusing on green technology.
“Moving from IT ventures to green technologies is nearly impossible, except for rare and extraordinary individuals like Vinod,” he says.
Mr Khosla, who clearly likes to see himself as a green iconoclast and financial maverick, is either very foolish or very clever.","“ENVIRONMENTALISTS are fiddling while Rome burns,” says Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture-capital firm. “They get in the way with silly stuff like asking people to walk more, drive less. That is an increment of 1-2% change. We need 1,000% change if billions of people in China and India are to enjoy a Western, energy-rich lifestyle.” Forget today's green technologies like electric cars, wind turbines, solar cells and smart grids, in other words. None meets what Mr Khosla calls the “Chindia price”—the price at which people in China and India will buy them without a subsidy. “Everything's a toy until it reaches that point,” he says.

Mr Khosla has a different plan to save the planet. He is investing over $1 billion of his clients' money in “black swans”—ideas with the potential for sudden jumps in technology that promise huge environmental benefits, easy scalability and rapid payback. The catch? Mr Khosla expects nine out of ten of his investments to fail.

“I am only interested in technologies that have a 90% chance of failure but, if they do succeed, would change the infrastructure of society in some radical way,” he says. Khosla Ventures' portfolio reads like an eco-utopian wish-list: non-polluting nuclear reactors; diesel from microbes; carbon-negative cement; quantum batteries; and a system for extracting methane from coal while it is still underground.

“Any one of these things is improbable but, if you have enough shots on goal, then it's very likely that something improbable will win,” he says. “Ten years ago, no analyst in the world would have predicted 650m cellphone subscribers in India but only 300m people with access to latrines and toilets. Even five years ago, no one would have predicted the way that Twitter took off. These are the black swan outliers.” Mr Khosla is keen to point out that he has caught a black swan before. In the mid-1990s, when working for Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a venture-capital firm, he invested $3m in Juniper Networks, a company making telecoms gear based on internet standards.

“At the time, every major telecommunications company told us that they would never switch to internet systems,” says Mr Khosla. Within just a few years, the internet boom had netted Kleiner Perkins a $7 billion return on its Juniper investment. Now Mr Khosla is gambling that venture capital can work similar magic in the field of clean technology. His approach is that of a pragmatic businessman rather than an eco-warrior. “I don't view climate change as a moral thing. I view it as a risk, no different from nuclear proliferation, terrorism or national defence,” he says. “Business is used to buying insurance, and this is insurance that it is imperative we buy.”

These high-tech insurance policies come in many flavours. Mr Khosla has invested in companies that promise ultra-efficient air conditioning using hypersonic vortices or desiccant chemicals. He is funding the commercialisation of low-power lighting, next-generation solar cells and super-strong building materials. But, like the environmentalists he scorns, Mr Khosla puts most of his energy into seeking alternatives to traditional fossil fuels.

“We remain primarily a gasoline-driven consumer economy,” he says. “I'm happy to see the price of oil going up, as it will incentivise us to replace fossil fuels.” Mr Khosla has invested in several biotechnology companies that aim to condense the multi-million-year process of creating oil from plant life into a matter of hours. Amyris, which was floated on the NASDAQ exchange last autumn, is using genetically engineered organisms to turn plant sugars into a precursor of diesel.

Never tell me the odds

Another start-up, KiOR, is hoping to go one step further, converting cellulosic biomass (such as waste wood and leaves) into a crude oil replacement called Re-Crude. Fans of cellulosic biofuels hope that they can produce ethanol without competing with food crops for agricultural land. According to Mr Khosla, KiOR can produce Re-Crude in America today for less than $90 a barrel. “Three years ago, I would have said that there was a 90% chance of KiOR failing. But these things aren't predictable. Forecasting is based on assumptions, and technology changes those assumptions,” says Mr Khosla. “I never compute returns. If you start forecasting cash flows, you lose innovation, you lose instinct. You average yourself down to mediocrity.”

No one is likely to accuse Mr Khosla of that. At the age of 20 he launched a soya-milk company in his home city of Delhi, targeting the multitudes in India who did not own a refrigerator. When it failed he moved to America to study biomedical engineering and business. In 1982 he co-founded Sun Microsystems, a maker of powerful workstation computers. After the company's initial public offering (IPO) in 1986, Mr Khosla left to become a venture capitalist. At Kleiner Perkins, Mr Khosla was involved in the early financing of Nexgen, an innovative chipmaker, and Excite, a search engine. He also had some high-profile flops, including Dynabook, a company that designed a tablet computer 20 years before the Apple iPad but proved unable to bring it to market.

“I've had many more failures than successes in my life,” admits Mr Khosla. “My willingness to fail gives me the ability to succeed.” His next move was characteristically unpredictable: he temporarily moved his family to India. “I wanted to see if I could have a social impact,” he says. “I quickly realised that any non-profit activity I could do would be no more than a drop in the ocean. Most non-profit organisations are completely ineffective. That's when I decided that I needed to look for scalable solutions, which meant self-propagating solutions, which meant capitalist solutions. Proving the capitalist tool as a solution for poverty is high on my priority list.”

Mr Khosla put several million dollars into SKS, a for-profit microfinance company. Although India's booming microfinance industry has since attracted criticism (and even government action) for its high interest rates and aggressive debt-collection practices, Mr Khosla is adamant that its benefits outweigh any ills. “Millions of people now have access to financial services,” he says. “That's more social than any non-profit thing I could have done. And guess what? In the process, I made $100m. You never know when something you're trying to be radical on will make you money.”

If Mr Khosla is unapologetic about making money while helping some of the world's poorest people, he is equally outspoken when it comes to the environmental movement in the West. “Wind projects are a waste of time. And the reality is that electric cars today are coal-powered cars, because the USA and much of Europe have mostly coal-based electricity,” he says. “Environmentalists use artificial rates of return, buried assumptions and ‘what if' assumptions about behaviour changes. It's useless crap.”

This sort of talk does not exactly endear Mr Khosla to environmentalists. “The solution to our energy problems is almost the exact opposite of what Khosla says,” declares Joseph Romm, who is the editor of Climate Progress, an influential climate blog, and a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress Action Fund, a think-tank. “Technology breakthroughs are unlikely to be the answer. Accelerated deployment of existing technologies will get you down the cost curve much more rapidly than a breakthrough.”

But Mr Khosla is standing behind his black swans. “We fool ourselves into thinking that if 5% of San Franciscans or rich Germans can afford a technology, then it's getting market traction. But only when an electric car can compete with a Tata Nano will you achieve scale, and that requires radical innovations in battery technology,” he says, referring to the world's cheapest production car. Accordingly, Khosla Ventures is funding several energy-storage systems, including high-efficiency solid-state batteries that sidestep the safety problems with today's lithium-ion cells.

It's all about diversification, says Mr Khosla: “We'll try half a dozen batteries. If other people try 30 more, only one has to work to completely change society.” Whether other investors will be prepared to take similar gambles on blue-sky technologies remains to be seen.

Going it alone

Although Khosla Ventures' two funds are fully subscribed, and have invested about $1.3 billion in over 40 companies, billions more dollars and many more start-ups will be needed to hatch a flock of black swans. Mr Khosla estimates that the amount of investment required to replace all the petrol consumed in America with renewable fuels will run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. But other high-tech venture capitalists seem to be steering clear of risky green investments.

“I would love to say that Vinod is starting a trend,” says Steve Westly, another venture capitalist focusing on green technology. “But no. Not everybody has the courage to do that. Even here in Silicon Valley, people find it hard to understand that if you think big, you're going to have some failures.” Mr Khosla thinks other investors will come round to his way of thinking eventually. “The climate will change as soon as we have a Netscape moment. When we have an IPO where people see they can make a billion dollars, everyone will start to invest.”

But Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, whose IPO kicked off the internet boom, thinks Silicon Valley investors will prefer to stick to information technology. He has even promised that his latest venture-capital fund will avoid “clean, green, energy and electric cars”. He argues that clean-tech is a very different field. “Moving from IT ventures to green technologies is nearly impossible, except for rare and extraordinary individuals like Vinod,” he says. “He has put years into becoming a master of the field, but it's not the entire Valley deciding to move into clean-tech.” Mr Khosla's mentor at Kleiner Perkins, John Doerr, has expressed concern over his own company's green investments and Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and a partner at the Founders Fund, has said that clean-tech companies “for a variety of reasons don't work”.

Facing both industry scepticism and the ire of environmentalists, Mr Khosla decided to engage Tony Blair, a former British prime minister, who joined Khosla Ventures last year as a senior adviser. The idea is that Mr Blair can provide a more diplomatic public face for the company, and he also brings global clout.

Mr Khosla, who clearly likes to see himself as a green iconoclast and financial maverick, is either very foolish or very clever. But at this point it is difficult to say which. “I try a lot of new things,” he says. “It's fun to play the game and fun to play the odds—and long odds win a lot of fun.” Mr Khosla's cold-blooded view of the economics of environmentalism has certainly ruffled some feathers. But if he turns out to be right, his quest for clean-tech black swans could be exactly what the planet needs.",https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2011/03/12/betting-on-green

Rather, they come from China’s leaders, who gathered this week in Beijing for a big annual meeting. On March 5th Li Keqiang, the prime minister, vowed to declare war on pollution.

The timing could not have been better, then, for the launch of a firm devoted to the manufacture of greener engines. The same day EcoMotors, a startup backed by Bill Gates and Khosla Ventures (supported by Vinod Khosla, a Californian venture capitalist), unveiled its joint venture with a division of China FAW Group, a local carmaker. The Chinese partner vowed to spend more than $200m on a factory in Shanxi, a northern province, that will produce 100,000 of the new engines a year.

The venture’s “OPOC” two-stroke engine, a novel twist on a century-old idea, consists of a pair of cylinders, each containing two opposing pistons. Its backers claim its fuel-efficiency will be up to 45% better than the four-stroke engines commonly used in cars. The technology was developed with financial help from the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, an arm of the Pentagon with a record of promoting breakthroughs (robot legs and self-driving cars are two others).

The engine can run on a variety of fuels. The plan is first to make diesel engines for use in lorries, and only later to consider petrol versions for cars. However, local boosters in Shanxi also want future configurations to burn methanol, which can be made from abundant local coal supplies.

Another noteworthy aspect of this deal, argues Andrew Chung of Khosla Ventures, is that it suggests the best way for inventive energy startups to achieve scale: make a big push in China. Despite the downturn in the solar business there (see article), Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research firm, estimates that the clean-technology market in China exceeded $60 billion last year, whereas America’s was less than $50 billion.

Commercialising new technologies is not easy in rich countries, says Amit Soman, the president of EcoMotors, since slow growth and legacy assets make incumbent manufacturers reluctant to take a punt on unproven new kit. But in China his firm has already reached two non-exclusive deals. In one of these, EcoMotors signed a $200m licensing agreement last April to let Zhongding Power make a version of its engines for diesel generators.

“The innovation cycle is being completed in China and other emerging economies, not America,” says Mr Chung. Maybe so, but there are two caveats. The first is that Chinese firms will not pay much for intellectual property, and will copy it as soon they figure out how. The second, observes Jonathan Woetzel of McKinsey, a consulting firm, is that only technology firms that “fit conveniently into the Chinese ecosystem”, to the benefit of local companies, will be allowed to prosper.

Consider the much-trumpeted recent arrival of Tesla Motors in China. The American electric-car firm unarguably has cutting-edge clean technology, but its business model of importing all its vehicles does not enrich powerful Chinese firms or transfer intellectual property to local joint ventures. So the subsidies and tax breaks lavished by China’s central and local governments on buyers of even the most wretched “new energy vehicles” made there will not be offered to purchasers of Tesla’s gorgeous green machines.",https://www.economist.com/business/2014/03/08/red-light-green-light

The country's huge oil wealth allows many of them to drive big, fuel-guzzling cars and live in huge, power-guzzling homes.

What is more, Abu Dhabi, the biggest of the country's seven princely city-states, has a huge vested interest in the continued domination of the world economy by fossil fuels. It sits atop some 8% of the world's proven reserves of oil. At current rates of extraction, the oil will last for another 92 years. So it is with some scepticism that the world has greeted Abu Dhabi's plans to reinvent itself as a crucible of greenery.

In 2006 Abu Dhabi's development agency unveiled the Masdar Initiative, to pursue “solutions to some of mankind's most pressing issues: energy security, climate change and truly sustainable human development”. The initiative consists of a research institute to develop environmental technologies, an investment arm to commercialise and deploy them, and an eco-city to house these two outfits and to serve as a test-bed for their ideas. All this, it is hoped, will turn Abu Dhabi into the Silicon Valley of clean technology, where green-minded academics, entrepreneurs and financiers will rub shoulders.

Thinking big

The project is nothing if not ambitious. Masdar's managers say they will create an academic institution on a par with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a global manufacturing hub for technologies such as solar power and desalination, and a city of 40,000 people with no greenhouse-gas emissions and no waste—all while turning a profit. The government of Abu Dhabi is putting up $15 billion in seed capital, but the investment arm and Masdar city are intended to be run on a commercial basis, in conjunction with other companies.

In the past, some of Abu Dhabi's grandiose schemes have come to nought—most notably a plan to build a global financial hub from scratch a decade ago. More recently, developers have suggested that they might scale back other splashy projects, such as a huge new cultural quarter. But Masdar is proceeding apace. Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed al-Nahyan, was excited about the idea from the start and is taking a personal interest in its progress, says Sultan al-Jaber, Masdar's boss.

Masdar Institute of Science and Technology (MIST) will admit its first students next year; the first phase of Masdar city is under construction and Masdar has built up a big portfolio of renewable-energy investments, including a stake in an offshore wind farm in Britain and three solar-thermal power plants in Spain. It has also placed an order for machinery for two solar-panel plants: one that is already under construction in Germany, and another that is to be built in Abu Dhabi itself.

Outsiders seem keen to get involved. MIT is helping MIST with the recruitment and training of its faculty. Credit Suisse, a Swiss bank, has invested $100m in the initiative's clean-tech fund—the same amount as Masdar itself. Foster + Partners, a British architecture firm, has come up with the master-plan for Masdar city. BP, a big oil firm, and Rio Tinto, a mining giant, will collaborate on a carbon-capture and storage scheme. Masdar is working with such partners not because it lacks capital, says Mr al-Jaber, but because it wants to take advantage of foreign expertise and have its ideas independently scrutinised.

It is Masdar city that has attracted the most scrutiny. To reduce its emissions, especially in such an unwelcoming environment, the city will employ all sorts of innovative and outlandish technology. All the buildings, naturally, will be supremely energy-efficient. Water will be recycled, to reduce the need for desalination. There will be dew-catchers, rainwater harvesting and electronic sensors to raise the alarm in case of leaky pipes. There will be green spaces, but with drought-resistant plants rather than the thirsty lawns and flowers that are the norm in Abu Dhabi.

No cars will be allowed. Instead, people will have to walk, or take “personal rapid transit”—small pods that will zoom around the city on tracks, akin to metro cars for individuals. Goods will be moved in the same way. The city will be walled, to keep out the hot desert wind. The lack of cars will allow for narrow, shaded streets that will also funnel breezes from one side of the city to the other.

Roofs, canopies and a large patch of land on the edge of the city will be given over to solar panels. The city is already testing 41 types of panel from 33 different manufacturers, to see which work best in the sunny, hot and dusty desert conditions. There will also be the odd wind turbine, solar water-heaters and small waste-to-energy facilities (the city's planners do not like to call them incinerators).

The plans leave space to adopt new technologies when they reach maturity. A spot has been saved for algae ponds that might some day produce biofuel, for example. For the time being they will be used for research. The whole city is being built on a raised platform, to give easier access to the pipes and wiring that would normally be buried underground and to allow the transport pods to zip around unfettered. That will also make it easier to install revolutionary new kit in future. Indeed, the source of roughly a fifth of the city's power supply has not yet been decided, on the assumption that there will be better options available by the time the project is due to be completed, in 2016.

Following the footprints

All this, it is hoped, will allow the city to produce more energy than it consumes and ensure that less than 2% of the waste it generates ends up in landfills. Carbon sequestered in the city's vegetation, along with exports of surplus green energy, should be enough to offset the emissions associated with construction, says Khaled Awad, who is managing the site. Contractors say they are keeping careful track of their carbon footprints and mutter about the difficulties of finding concrete and steel with a high recycled component. A bewildering array of recycling bins stands prominently in the waiting area of the site office.

A vision of the clean-tech future

But the city's zero-carbon claim is a bit of a fudge. For one thing, the city will not produce enough energy to power itself at night, due to its reliance on solar panels. Instead, it will import gas-fired power from Abu Dhabi's grid, at least until energy-storage technology improves. It will make up for this in its carbon accounting by exporting excess solar power to the grid during the day. In addition, to keep energy use down, the city will not allow any energy-intensive industries within its boundaries, even though spurring local manufacturing is a big part of the Masdar initiative.

Furthermore, in itself, Masdar will do little to improve Abu Dhabi's carbon footprint. Cheap oil, natural gas and power will continue to spur emissions-intensive industry and conspicuous consumption. Next to Masdar city, a Formula One racetrack and a Ferrari-themed amusement park are being built. In fact, Mubadala, the development agency behind Masdar, owns a 5% stake in Ferrari and sponsors its Formula One team. Just a few miles up the road, it is building the world's biggest aluminium smelter, complete with its own gas-fired power plant. A nearby mall is even planning to install an indoor ski slope, like the one in nearby Dubai.

But Masdar's creators, to be fair, seem to see it more as a development project than as an environmental one. They do not pretend that Abu Dhabi is about to wean itself off oil and gas. But its rulers, they say, want to diversify its economy, in preparation for the day it runs out of oil—or of customers for it. Since local workers and officials have already built up some expertise in energy, it makes sense to capitalise on that.

What is more, Abu Dhabi, with its intense, year-round sunlight and desperate thirst for water, is ideally suited to develop technologies such as solar power and desalination. And thanks to all that oil, there is no shortage of capital. Masdar plans to help finance promising technologies at all stages of development. It will set up its own incubator to nourish local start-ups, in addition to the clean-tech fund and other strategic investments in mature firms.

Human capital, however, is another story. Mr al-Jaber says that Masdar has studied successful technology clusters around the world in an effort to recreate the same conditions in Abu Dhabi. He is particularly keen to mimic the welcoming regulatory environment and efficient infrastructure of places such as Singapore and Ireland. Foreign firms setting up shop in Masdar city will, he points out, be able to work without local partners if they want, and to move capital freely in and out of the country. There will be strong protection of intellectual property and little in the way of paperwork. Most alluringly, they will not pay any taxes.

MIST, meanwhile, seeks to entice great minds with the promise of minimal teaching requirements—just one course at a time—and plenty of opportunities to pursue original research. The “open laboratory” of Masdar city is another draw, says Marwan Khraisheh, who runs the institute. It has succeeded in recruiting faculty or students from grand American universities such as Cornell, MIT and Princeton.

Masdar itself, meanwhile, has recruited such figures as Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the United Nations' climate panel, and John Browne, a former boss of BP, to help select the winner of a prize for innovation in energy. Britain's Prince Charles is a patron. In the project's headquarters, renewable-energy executives hoping to sell their wares fill the waiting room, while thrusting young staffers of many nationalities rush to and fro. Jonathon Porritt, a celebrated British environmentalist, ambles past.

Of course, Abu Dhabi is still not Silicon Valley. MIST is tiny, and will not admit its first doctoral student until 2011. The city has a miserable climate and little in the way of entertainment apart from malls and restaurants. But it is more cosmopolitan and less conservative than many imagine. Most foreigners arriving in Abu Dhabi for the first time find it “better than they expect”, says Mr Khraisheh. Perhaps the same will be true of Masdar, too.",https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2008/12/06/masdar-plan
