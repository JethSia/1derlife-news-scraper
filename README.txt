1. If you have Jupyter Notebook (downloadable at https://www.anaconda.com/),
you can open the .ipynb file there.

- You can also the .ipynb file at https://colab.research.google.com/

2. If you have Python on your PC (https://www.python.org/downloads/), you can run the .py files.

- Run prepare.py only once. This just installs the needed modules for the program.
- Run main.py to run the scraper. Answer the user input questions to set the scraper.


*Both programs make a csv file of the scraped websites and place it in the Processed Topics folder*
